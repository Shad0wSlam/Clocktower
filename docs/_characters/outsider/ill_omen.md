summary: |
    The Ill Omen knows who trust and that they must die.

    - If an Ill Omen's known player becomes evil, they no longer need to die.
    - If there are less or more Minions in the game due to abilities, the Ill Omen still learns the normal amount of players.

  While preparing the first night, put a **OMEN** reminder by any good character token for each Minion that should be in a game of your player count. During the first night, wake the Ill Omen. Point to the players marked **OMEN**. Put the Ill Omen to sleep.

  During any day, regardless of whether the Ill Omen is alive, if the game would end today and there is a living good player marked **OMEN**, declare that the game is over and the evil team has won.
examples:
  - There are 11 players in the game. The Ill Omen learns the Steward and the [[Mercenary]]. On the final day, all three are dead and 3 other players live. The Ill Omen does not end the game.
  - There are 8 players in the game. Despite the Lil Monsta adding a Minion, the Ill Omen still only learns the [[Torpor]]. On the final day, the Torpor lives, so evil immediately wins.
