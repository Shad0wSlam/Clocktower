summary: |
    The Torpor inflicts a torpor around the town which must affect evil when good wins.

    - Torpor may publicly choose a player to take the Torpor ability. Once they have, they no longer have an ability.
    - The most recent player chosen by a Torpor ability has the Torpor ability, and cannot choose a player with it the day they receive it.
    - If a good player currently has the Torpor ability, good cannot win.
    - If the Demon is dead & a good player has the Torpor ability, continue to wake the Demon for their ability.

  During setup, mark the Torpor with the **TORPOR** reminder.

  Each day, once only, if a player with the **TORPOR** reminder declares they wish to use the Torpor ability, prompt them to choose a player. Move the **TORPOR** reminder to the chosen player.

  If the player with the **TORPOR** reminder is good, and good would win for any reason, the game continues. If the Demon is dead, they continue to have and use their ability.
examples:
  - The Torpor chooses the Empath with their ability. That day, the Demon dies. That night, the Demon wakes to kill a player. The next day, the Empath chooses the [[Biblioclast]] with the Torpor ability. Good wins immediately as the Demon is dead.
  - The Torpor never uses their ability. On the final day, three players live and the Demon is executed. Evil wins, as good cannot win and only two players live.
  - On the first day, the Torpor chooses the [[Sentry]] with their ability. Later that day, the Demon is 'about to die'. The [[Sentry]] attempts to use the Torpor ability on a good player, but is reminded they cannot. The Demon is executed that day, and good wins.
