summary: |
    The Gubbin is making the game very silly.

    - Each night, the Storyteller decides something to happen at some point that night or during the following day. What the something is is not limited in any way, and can be whatever the Storyteller wants to have happen.
    - The following night, if the Gubbin is still alive, they learn what the Storyteller had happen the previous day.
howtorun: |
  Each night, decide what happens tonight or today. Do whatever is required to facilitate the something.

  Each night except the first, write down what happened the previous night. Wake the Gubbin and show them the written information. Put the Gubbin to sleep. Then decide what happens next.
examples:
  - On the first night, the Storyteller decides that the Snake Charmer acts another two times. When they wake the Snake Charmer, they ask them to choose a player, and then do that two more times. The next night, the Gubbin learns that the Snake Charmer acted another two times.
  - On the third night, the Storyteller decides that a good player becomes the Mutant. That day, the Gubbin is executed, so that night does not learn about the Mutant.
  - On the second night, the Storyteller decides that good cannot win that day. Later that night, the Gubbin dies. During the day, the [[Mercenary]]'s target dies & the good team wins, as the Gubbin is dead.
