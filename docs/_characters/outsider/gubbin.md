    The Gubbin is making the game very silly.

    - If the Paranoiac has caused all other players to be evil, the character type distribution does not change.
    - If the Paranoiac guesses that everyone else is evil, and they are, the good team wins. If they are not, the good team loses.
    - If the Paranoiac loses their ability for any reason, such as dying, becoming poisoned, changing character or any other reason, they can still guess with the Paranoiac ability.

  While preparing the first night, decide whether all other players are evil. If they are, wake every player but the Paranoiac, show the **YOU ARE** info token then give a thumbs down. Show them **THIS PLAYER IS** info token, then the Paranoiac token, and then point to the Paranoiac player. Put all the players to sleep. If all other players are not evil, do nothing.

  If the Paranoiac chooses to guess that everyone else is evil, declare the game is over. If the Paranoiac turned players evil, declare the good team has won, otherwise declare the evil team has won.
examples:
  - The Paranoiac has not affected the game. They guess that everyone else is evil. The evil team immediately wins.
  - The Paranoiac has made all other players evil. On the first night, every other player is woken together, informed they are evil and who the Paranoiac is. On the second night, the Paranoiac is killed. The following day, they guess all players are evil and they immediately win.
