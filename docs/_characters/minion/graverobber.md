    The Graverobber sees the Grimoire and uses dead player's abilities.

    - The Graverobber sees the Grimoire every night, but only has the chosen player's ability if they are dead.
    - If the Graverobber dies, they lose the ability they have gained unless the ability works while they are dead.

  Each night, wake the Graverobber and show them the Grimoire for as long as they need. The Graverobber may point to a character token in the Grimoire. If they do, mark them with the **BODYSNATCHED** reminder. Put the Graverobber to sleep.

  If that player dies, or is dead, the Graverobber has that ability. Treat them as if they had the ability, such as waking them in the night to use it.
examples:
  - On the first night, the Graverobber chooses the Gossip. That day, they gossip "There is a Graverobber in-play", and the Gossip is executed that day. That night, the Graverobber does not choose a new character, so later that night their Gossip ability causes a player to die.
  - On the third night, the Imp chooses themselves to die and the Baron becomes the Imp. The next night, the Graverobber chooses the dead Imp. That night, both the Graverobber and the Baron-turned-Imp attack a player using their Imp ability.
