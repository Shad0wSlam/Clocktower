summary: |
    The Sentry lets extra Outsiders into the game.

    - If the not in-play Outsiders change during the game, the Sentry is not informed of the change.
    - If the Sentry tries to create an in-play Outsider, they are prompted to choose a different Outsider.

  While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag, add an Outsider token and remove a Townsfolk token, remove an Outsider token and add a Townsfolk token, or do neither. 

  During the first night, wake the Sentry. Show them the character tokens of all not in-play Outsiders. Put the Sentry to sleep.

  Each night except the first, wake the Sentry. They either shake their head no or point at any player and a not in-play Outsider icon on their character sheet. Put the Sentry to sleep. Wake the chosen player. Show them the **YOU ARE** info token, then their new character token, then put them to sleep. Replace their old character token with the new character token. 
examples:
  - The Sentry learns that the Recluse and the [[Torpor]] are not in play. On the second night, the Sentry chooses to turn the [[Mercenary]] into the Recluse.
  - The Sentry learns that the Mutant is not in play. On the third night, the Sentry chooses to turn themselves into the Mutant. That day, they are \"mad\" as the Mutant, and are executed.
