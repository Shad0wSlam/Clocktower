summary: |
    The Biblioclast uses Outsiders to burn town's info.

    - The Biblioclast is not told in advance how many Outsiders are not in-play, and must keep choosing characters until the Storyteller prompts them to stop.
    - If the Biblioclast chooses a not in-play character, that choice results in nothing.
    - If a player gains a chosen ability, even if they are not the character, the ability yields false information.

  While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag, add an Outsider token and remove a Townsfolk token, remove an Outsider token and add a Townsfolk token, or do neither. 

  During the first night, wake the Biblioclast. If all Outsiders are in-play, shake your head no and put the Biblioclast. Otherwise, prompt them to choose a character. Mark that character with the **FALSE** reminder. Continue prompting them for each other not in-play Outsider, then put the Biblioclast to sleep.

  While the Biblioclast is alive, you must give false information whenever an ability marked **FALSE** prompts you to give information.
examples:
  - The Drunk and the [[Paranoiac]] are not in play. On the first night, the Biblioclast is woken and prompted to choose a character. They choose the Empath. They are prompted to choose another character, and they choose the [[Ordinator]]. That night, the Empath has 2 evil neighbours, so they learn a 1.
  - Only 1 Outsider is not in play. The Biblioclast chooses the Knight. The Knight is not in play. On the third night, the Philosopher chooses to gain the Knight's ability, and learns the Demon and the Biblioclast.
  - All Outsiders are in play. The Biblioclast is woken on the first night, told no, and put to sleep.
