summary: |
    The Ordinator knows how much evil wanted to kill each execution.

    - The Ordinator does not track votes on executions that did not go through, only the votes for the execution that happened.
    - If a good player votes on the execution, then becomes evil, the Ordinator does not count them.
    - If a player is executed without being voted on, the Ordinator learns a 0.
howtorun: |
  Each day, after tallying votes for an execution, mark all evil players who voted with a **VOTED** reminder, and unmark any who did not.

  Each night except the first, wake the Ordinator. Show fingers (0, 1, 2, etc.) equaling the number of players with **VOTED** reminders. Put the Ordinator to sleep. Remove all **VOTED** reminders.
examples:
  - The Demon is shown that the Mercenary's target is the [[Ordinator]]. That day, the Savant is executed. Good wins immediately.
  - The Fortune Teller is the Mercenary's target. On the final day, only the [[Mercenary]], [[Torpor]], [[Sentry]], [[The Queens]], [[Parasite]], the Fortune Teller and the Mercenary live. The Fortune Teller is executed, and good wins due to the Mercenary ability.
