summary: |
    The Landlord houses Outsiders.

    - The players the Landlord chooses do not need to die the night they are chosen, if they die at night at any time after being chosen the Landlord's ability triggers.
    - If there are no living Outsiders when the Landlord ability triggers, nothing happens.
    - During setup, the Storyteller may choose to add an Outsider due to the Landlord's ability.
    - The Townsfolk that Outsiders become can be in-play or not in-play.

  During setup, you may add an Outsider.
  
  Each night except the first, wake the Landlord. They point at a player. Put the Landlord to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the **CHOSEN** reminder.

  If a player marked as **CHOSEN** dies at night, replace a living Outsider's character token with a Townsfolk character. Wake that player and show them the **YOU ARE** info token, then their new character token. Put them to sleep.
examples:
  - On the second night, the Landlord chooses the Empath. That night, the Demon kills the Empath. The [[King of Storms]] is awoken to learn they have become the Steward, and then learns a player from their Steward ability.
  - On the third night, the Landlord chooses the Godfather, and chose the [[Ahimsa]] the previous night. The Shabaloth attacks the Godfather and the [[Ahimsa]], so the two living Outsiders, the [[Torpor]] and the Drunk, become [[Ahimsa]] and the Minstrel.
