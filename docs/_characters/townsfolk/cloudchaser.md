    The Cloudchaser spends their time thinking about other things.

    - The info the Cloudchaser can learn can be any info signal the Storyteller would usually use, such as pointing at a player, a character, a direction, showing a number or more.
    - During the day, if the Cloudchaser requests a word, the Storyteller tells them any single word that helps understand the info. The word can be game related or unrelated.
    - If the Cloudchaser requests new info, the info must still be possible to have communicated at night with signals.

  While preparing the first night, decide what info to show the Cloudchaser. During the first night, wake the Cloudchaser and signal the info. Put the Cloudchaser to sleep.

  Each day, the Cloudchaser requests either a word or new info. If they request a word, tell them 1 word that helps understand their more recent info. If they request new info, tell them new info that could have been communicated at night.
examples:
  - The Cloudchaser learns a 2. On the first day, they request a word and learn "Type". On their second day, they request another word and learn "Outsiders". They correctly deduce that they learned the amount of Outsiders in-play. On their third day, they request new info and learn the Fortune Teller and [[Krown]] players. They die that night before they can deduce that they learned 2 players, 1 of which is the Demon.
  - The Cloudchaser learns a 5. On their first day, they assume they have learned the longest chain of Townsfolk and request new info. They learn themselves, the Amnesiac and the [[Gubbin]]. The next day, they request a topic and learn "Storytold". They are executed that day, before they can deduce that they learned the players with Storyteller-chosen abilities.
