    The Mercenary keeps a good player alive, then finds them.

    - If the Mercenary's target dies by any means, including a Demon kill or execution, good wins.
    - If the Mercenary dies, they no longer win if their target dies.
    - If the Mercenary's target becomes evil, they are still the target.

  While preparing the first night, put the **TARGET** reminder by any good character token. During the first night, wake the Demon. Show them the **THIS CHARACTER SELECTED YOU** info token, then the Mercenary token, then the player marked **TARGET**. Put that player to sleep.

  If the Mercenary's target dies, declare that the game is over and the good team has won.

  If the Mercenary died tonight, wake them and point to the player marked **TARGET**. Put the Mercenary to sleep.
