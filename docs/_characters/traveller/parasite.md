    The Parasite attaches to a player.

    - The Parasite must choose a player each day. If they have on a previous day and do not, it can be assumed they choose the player they last chose.
    - The Parasite sits in the same seat as the player they have chosen. Abilities affecting neighbours register both the Parasite and their chosen player as a neighbour.
    - The Parasite and their chosen player can vote separately, but their votes are counted at the same time.

  During the day, once the Parasite chooses a player, move their token to share with the chosen player's. Mark the chosen player with the **TRUE INFO** reminder if the Parasite is good, or the **POISONED** reminder if the Parasite is evil and the chosen player is good.

  A player marked **TRUE INFO** receives true info whenever they receive info (even if they're also marked **DRUNK** or **POISONED**).

  A player marked **POISONED** is poisoned until the Parasite chooses a different player.
examples:
  - The good Parasite chooses the Fisherman, who neighbours the No Dashii. That day, the Fisherman chooses to receive their advice, and receives sober & healthy advice.
  - The evil Parasite chooses the Oracle. That night, no evil players are dead but the Oracle receives a 1. The next day, the Parasite chooses the Demon. They are not poisoned, because the Demon is evil.
