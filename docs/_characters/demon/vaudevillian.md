summary: |
    The Vaudevillian has many Marionettes.

    - The evil team starts with an extra evil player when the Vaudevillian is in play.
    - Both Marionettes must neighbour the Vaudevillian.
    - Any abilities that players think they have, such as by being a Marionette, or by being drunk or poisoned, might work anyway.
    - If a Vaudevillian is created mid game, the Vaudevillian does not receive an extra Minion nor do they have to neighbour Marionettes.

  While setting up the game, before putting the character tokens in the bag, remove one Minion character token and add a Townsfolk token.

  If there is still a Minion token in play, remove the Vaudevillian token and add another Townsfolk token. During the first night, swap a good player who has only good neighbour's characters token with the Vaudevillian token. Wake this player, show them the **YOU ARE** info token then the Vaudevillian character token, then the **YOU ARE** info token then a thumbs down, then put them to sleep. They are now the evil Vaudevillian.

  During the first night, mark both player neighbouring the Vaudevillian with an **IS THE MARIONETTE** reminder. Wake the Vaudevillian. Point to both their neighbours and show the Marionette character token. Put the Demon to sleep.

  Any time a player who does not have an ability they think they do tries to use that ability, it might work anyway.

  Each night except the first, wake the Vaudevillian. They point at any player. That player **dies** - mark them with the **DEAD** reminder. Put the Vaudevillian to sleep.
examples:
  - After setup, the Vaudevillian neighbours the Undertaker and the Puzzlemaster. Both are actually the Marionette. The Storyteller decides that the Marionette who thinks they are the Puzzlemaster will drunk another player despite not being the Puzzlemaster.
  - The Drunk thinks they are the Gossip. When they gossip that a Vaudevillian is in play, they do not cause a player to die. Later, when they gossip that they are the Gossip, they do cause a player to die.
