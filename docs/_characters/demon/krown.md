summary: |
    The Krown is not in play until someone wears it.

    - At the start of the game, the Storyteller is Krown. The Minions do not learn a Demon during the first night. When the Krown kills, if the Storyteller is still Krown, they choose a player to die.
    - At dusk, after players have closed their eyes for the night to begin, players may raise their hand to ask for the Krown. If the Storyteller is the Krown, the first player to do so becomes evil & the Krown, and the Minions learn who this is.
    - When a player becomes Krown, they are no longer their previous character. They do not receive bluffs and are not told who their Minions are.
    - If the Storyteller is still the Krown on the final day, good players cannot execute the Demon and the Minions likely win.

  While setting up the game, before putting the character tokens in the bag, remove the Krown token and add an extra Townsfolk token.

  After you ask players to close their eyes at the end of the day, wait to see if any players raise their hand to take the Krown. If any do, wake the first to do so and show them the **YOU ARE** info token, then the **Krown** token & a thumbs-down. Put them to sleep. Replace their character token with the Krown token, then wake the Minions. Show them the **THIS PLAYER IS** info token, then the **Krown** token, then point at the Krown player.

  Each night except the first, wake the Krown and they point at a player. Put the Krown to sleep. If no player is the Krown yet, the Storyteller chooses a player. The chosen player **dies** - mark them with a **DEAD** reminder.
examples:
  - The Godfather wakes to learn that there is no Demon. At the start of the next night, the [[Landlord]] raises their hand and becomes the evil Krown. The Godfather is woken to learn that they are the Krown. That night, the Krown is woken to choose a player to attack.
  - The [[Graverobber]] and Xaan wake to learn there is no Demon. Throughout the game, no player takes the Krown, so the Storyteller chooses who the Krown attacks. On the final day, no player is the Krown. The [[Gubbin]] is executed, and the evil team wins.
