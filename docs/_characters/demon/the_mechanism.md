summary: |
    The Mechanism watches misinformation tick around the town.

    - On the first night, the closest player clockwise from each evil player is poisoned, if that player is a Townsfolk. Each night, the poisons move one player clockwise.
    - If a poisoned Townsfolk becomes a non-Townsfolk, they become healthy. If a non-Townsfolk that would be poisoned becomes a Townsfolk, they do become poisoned.
    - When the fourth day ends and night begins, if the Mechanism is still alive, evil wins.

  While preparing the first night, put a **POISONED** reminder on each player clockwise of an evil player. If any **POISONED** reminders are on non-Townsfolk, turn the reminder upside-down to remind you that the player is not poisoned. Each following night, move every **POISONED** reminder to the next clockwise player, turning reminds as necessary.

  Immediately after dawn on the first day, mark the Mechanism with the **DAY 1** reminder. At the beginning of each following day, mark the Mechanism with **DAY 2**, then **DAY 3**, then **DAY 4**. If a day ends and the Mechanism is marked with the **DAY 4** reminder, declare that evil wins.
examples:
  - The Artist is the clockwise neighbour of the Mechanism, and the Seamstress is the clockwise neighbour of the [[Sentry]]. On the first night, both are poisoned by the Mechanism. On the second night, both become healthy. Their clockwise neighbours are the Politician and the Plague Doctor, so neither become poisoned.
  - On the fourth day, the Steward is executed. The evil team wins.
