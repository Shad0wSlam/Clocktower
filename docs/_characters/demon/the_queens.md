    The Queens kill the town together, even if one of them die.

    - The Queens wake together to learn who their Minions are, if any, and receive their bluffs. They can receive the same bluffs as each other, or different bluffs.
    - A The Queens might die in the night, if the Storyteller thinks it is appropriate. This is often used to prevent both The Queens being alive on the final day.

  While setting up the game, before putting the character tokens in the bag, remove one Minion character token and add a second The Queens character token. 

  Each night except the first, wake one The Queens. They point at any player. Put them to sleep, then repeat this with the other The Queens if they are alive. Choose a chosen player, or a The Queens, to **die** - mark them with a **DEAD** reminder and a shroud.
examples:
  - Anna and Emm are The Queens. On the first night, they wake together to learn that they have no Minions, and each receive their bluffs. The following night, each choose a player to die. The Storyteller decides that the player Anna chose dies. On the second day, Emm is executed. That night, only Anna wakes to choose a player to die.
  - On the final night, both The Queens are alive, along with two good players. Each The Queens chooses one of the good players. The Storyteller chooses that one of The Queens dies.
