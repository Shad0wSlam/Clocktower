It's Zero Hour in the Manor of the Delinquent, as evil and good alike will struggle to discern who surround them.

Zero Hour is my new, even more advanced speculative script of Midnight in the House of the Damned, designed with a focus on emulating as much as we know about Midnight. You'll recognise some characters, such as the armies of Legion or the woeful Damsel, but some new characters await too!
