The chime of the clocktower tolls, the reverberations felt inside every human, and more, stood in the town. The clockface, it's normally unfettered marble, now covered in a myriad of brass mechanisms and gears. As they approach their final revolution, the town and time stands to attention. It's the Eleventh Hour for Ravenswood Bluff.

Welcome to the Eleventh Hour! A script built around the terrifyingly systematic demon, [[The Mechanism]], a timer Demon, and accompanied by a host of terrifyingly tricky Minions.

Beware [[The Mechanism]] itself, as every chime brings it's hands of poison swinging once more.
Watch out for your neighbours and the dissident they might sow with the Dissovant, the Esper (a Bootlegger's Anthology classic, credit Elluna), or if the [[Sentry]] is allowing those town gates open.
Do not fall afoul of the cries of the Occultist (credit Elluna), no matter how right they may sound, but do take note of the dedicant [[Ordinator]], etching runes of the town's swayings.
