Welcome to the Garden of Speculation, a leisurely paced game full of strange logic and counterintuitive information!

Garden of Speculation is my take on speculating Garden of Sin, designed with a focus on emulating as much as we know about the Garden of Sin. Many characters, such as the Leviathan or Atheist, are instantly recognisable, but some new speculative characters await you too! To fully fulfil the vision, one of my own homebrews is used here too, the [[Biblioclast]], a powerful information reversal Minion in it's own right!
