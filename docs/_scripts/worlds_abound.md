Worlds Abound is a script built around the idea of the Demons, and making it difficult to solve for which is in play. In fact, when building possible worlds, players may find that many abound.

### ST Notes:

-  Avoid giving info if at all possible that solves for Demon type ambiguity. Generally, Town will narrow it down to 1 of 2 Demon types fairly easily, but the final step should be far more difficult.
-  Putting a Damsel in a Legion game should be considered entirely legal and possible, by registering a Legion as a Spy to the Damsel-Spy jinx, therefore permanently poisoning the Damsel.
- Every Townsfolk is affected by Vortox, as per RAW. This includes Fisherman giving advice that doesn't help win (or, most fun, advice that helps lose), and any Cannibal abilities (whether poisoned or not) yielding false information.
- The Drunk and the Marionette can, and often should, receive true information in a Vortox game. A Drunk Steward who saw a good player, for example, can really help throw the good team off of a Vortox world.
- Legion is always also a Minion, so they will always trigger a Town Crier, can be used for statements about Minions to a Savant, and can count for Minion Juggles
