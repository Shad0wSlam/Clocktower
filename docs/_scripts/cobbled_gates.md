The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and those very same good intentions now come through our town's gates.

Cobbled Gates is a script built around a powerful good team, drenched in information, but similarly plagued with game ending effects. It uses a few key homebrew characters that have been tested to various degrees, and as such this is a playtest script.

Revel in the [[Mercenary]] who can tame even the wildest evil team, or the [[Ordinator]] who can find them all by how loud they sway! Meanwhile, beware the [[Paranoiac]], who can end the game on a dime if you say the wrong thing, or the [[Ill Omen]] sabotaging the town from the inside with shame on their face.

Even still, [[The Queens]] stalk this town, a Demon that ride in a pair, or the [[Vaudevillian]], a Demon who masterminds their team.
