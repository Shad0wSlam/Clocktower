The sun beats down overhead, and Demons rise underfoot. When the Town finds the power of their sacred Square stolen, how will they ever coordinate to repel those evils? 

Vultures Circling is a script built using official characters and unofficial, speculative, characters, oriented around high-power plays, nominations, and voting. Town will have to choose carefully who they'd like to execute each day, but beware certain traps the evil-doers have for them.
