As Dusk falls in the Home of the Perturbed, evil and good alike will stuggle to discern who surround them.

Dusk is my speculative script of Midnight in the House of the Damned, designed with a focus on being a good script rather than a precise emulation. You'll recognise some characters, such as the armies of Legion or the woeful Damsel, but some new characters await too!
