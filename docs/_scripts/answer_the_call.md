The horns blare as the call of sacrifice goes out. Will you answer it?

Answer the Call is a script built using official characters and unofficial, speculative, characters, oriented around difficult choices regarding who lives and who dies. Town will have an unprecedented amount of control over who dies throughout the game, but as they so often do, evil have their own ways to force town's hand.
